SDG: Goal 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production
Idea: AI-Powered Waste Management Optimization(Use AI to optimize waste collection, sorting, and recycling processes, reducing landfill waste and improving sustainability)
Solution: Develop an AI system to predict waste generation, optimize collection routes, and automate recyclable material classification.
Key Features:
I) AI-driven waste prediction and tracking
II) Route optimization for efficient collection
III) Smart waste sorting with image recognition

Dataset:
TrashNet (Image classification of waste)
Waste Management Open Data (Municipal waste statistics)

Roadmap:
a) Build waste classification model, optimize routes using AI
b) Integrate  real-time waste data and evaluate performance

12/03/2025, 3:22 pm - +251 98 340 8740: So, what are we supposed to do next?
12/03/2025, 3:23 pm - +251 96 323 2349: Prepare urself
12/03/2025, 4:50 pm - Tina: For what?
13/03/2025, 4:39 pm - +251 98 340 8740: What is really expected from us guys...
13/03/2025, 4:39 pm - +251 98 340 8740: I think tomorrow is the deadline.
13/03/2025, 4:39 pm - +251 91 053 3748: We are supposed to do the project with python
13/03/2025, 4:53 pm - +251 96 323 2349: Hi Team I’m currently busy with other tasks—please take a time to do  the project. I trust you’ve got this, and I appreciate your support!
13/03/2025, 5:44 pm - +251 98 340 8740: Any progress by far?
13/03/2025, 5:45 pm - +251 96 323 2349: No
13/03/2025, 8:54 pm - +251 98 340 8740: So what shall we do?
13/03/2025, 8:54 pm - +251 98 340 8740: Let's discuss and start doing the task

13/03/2025, 9:11 pm - +251 98 340 8740: Could you Share us the ppt file (if there is any) you use for yesterday's presentation
13/03/2025, 9:28 pm - +251 96 323 2349: sry, i didn't prepare the ppt
13/03/2025, 10:08 pm - +251 98 340 8740: Ok
13/03/2025, 10:09 pm - +251 98 340 8740: Anyone here with previous ML experience?
13/03/2025, 10:12 pm - +251 91 053 3748: This task is to be done
13/03/2025, 10:12 pm - +251 91 053 3748: Only using python
13/03/2025, 10:12 pm - +251 91 053 3748: No ML yet
13/03/2025, 10:13 pm - +251 91 053 3748: After we learn mL then we can apply that
13/03/2025, 10:54 pm - +251 98 340 8740: However, the project we selected is a machine learning project, not just a basic or general Python project.
13/03/2025, 10:55 pm - +251 91 053 3748: The project everyone selected is that way
13/03/2025, 10:55 pm - +251 91 053 3748: Please ask Eda for further clarifications incase I am mistaken
13/03/2025, 10:57 pm - +251 98 340 8740: Maybe I am mistaken, 
Could you explain to me what exactly (as a team and individual)is expected from us/me
13/03/2025, 10:57 pm - +251 91 053 3748: I'm not so sure like I said I maybe mistaken
13/03/2025, 10:58 pm - +251 91 053 3748: I tot it was a python project
13/03/2025, 10:59 pm - +251 98 340 8740: I heard that failure to participate in the hackathon will lead to termination from the boot camp
13/03/2025, 11:00 pm - +251 98 340 8740: What about other group members?
No one here
14/03/2025, 1:05 am - Tina: Agree...and I don't think machine learning project can be done with in 1 day or 2...we have to ask Eda what exactly needed to submit
14/03/2025, 1:06 am - +251 91 053 3748: It is python.
14/03/2025, 4:31 am - +251 91 053 3748: Guys I have done a simple version of this but it has issues because it is simple python and not ML obviously and also it is kind of simple and just does a simple task. But maybe u guys have done better
14/03/2025, 4:32 am - +251 91 053 3748: I tried to do it because I didn't see any u guys using Google collab or other methods to code
14/03/2025, 4:32 am - +251 91 053 3748: Idk if what I tried was what was intended but I will send it tmw
14/03/2025, 8:51 am - +251 96 323 2349: ts, could you prepare the documentation to be submitted?
14/03/2025, 10:12 am - Tina: I have created github repository ..send me your account name so we can collaborate and push our codes there

14/03/2025, 11:57 am - +251 91 053 3748: Using this as an example
14/03/2025, 11:57 am - +251 91 053 3748: We need to dicuss our project

14/03/2025, 11:59 am - +251 91 053 3748: Project cost roadmap development etc need to be discussed and made into a ppt like eda said using the template above. I suggest we discuss.
14/03/2025, 12:01 pm - +251 96 323 2349: you did great!!!
14/03/2025, 12:05 pm - +251 91 053 3748: It is not machine learning so accuracy is very low please if any of u have a better implementation or idea present it for us thank u

14/03/2025, 9:20 pm - +251 91 053 3748: U can show the code. If you'd like and then for ui we can tell them as a back up we have coded mine and I can show them the ui but network isn't allowing me to use my PC I joined the meeting thru my phone so lemme try w pc for a bit
14/03/2025, 9:20 pm - +251 91 053 3748: And I'll let uk
14/03/2025, 9:20 pm - +251 91 053 3748: Until then try to install if it doesn't work we can try this method
